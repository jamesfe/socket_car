This project has dragged on too long.

I need to do a few things:

1. Finalize GPIO code
2. Finalize a little more websocket code (return some status info and display it in the front end)
3. Finalize the PHYSICAL MODEL

For some reason (probably my own git-failure) I lost my "thoughts on electronics" from two months ago and I've been in a funk about it.  I should just cut my losses and rewrite, which is what I will start to do here.

Here are the major divisions:


## Propulsion

- [ ] Wheels
- [ ] Mount wheels to motors
- [ ] Mount wheels to steering components

## Steering

- [ ] Servo
- [ ] Power the servo
- [ ] Control the servo

## Drive

- [ ] Motor
- [ ] Power Source
- [ ] Interface to rPi

## Power

- [ ] Battery
- [ ] Charge the battery
- [ ] Control discharge (do not burn things out)

## Brains/Processing 

- [ ] Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Wires to outboard
- [ ] Some power requirements

## Chassis & Physical Platform

- [ ] Wood? Cardboard? Metal?
- [ ] Mounting things stably
