# Notes

Today I found a bug in how I was using `left` instead of `left_motor`.  This was luckily caught by the unit tests but it was still annoying.  Hopefully this kind of thing doesn't happen when I launch.

Next up I think I'll do some routine stuff - the health check endpoint and function in the car, the physical state callback and start work on the logging.  Also, I need to look into GPIO libraries.  

Do I need to use an ESC or can I just control the motor with voltage?  I don't know a lot about electronics so it's going to be a little tough.  We'll see how it goes.

Finally, the front end leaves a lot of work to be done.  I'll sketch out some of the things it needs to accomplish before I get to work on that, but there are many decisions to make there.  We can split this problem into chunks.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create a callback to the physical state
- [ ] Do more research on ESCs and motors
- [ ] Create a framework for logging things out to file
- [ ] Create an endpoint to return last n states of the vehicle
- [ ] Create a health check
- [X] *easy* do the inc/dec speed work on the websocket handler
- [ ] Return a health check with every command
- [ ] **front end** needs much research and work
