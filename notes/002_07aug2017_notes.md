# Notes 07 Aug 2017

I haven't had much priority for this project but I need to get it off the ground.  I'd like to work a bit more on the server.

## Plan of Attack

We start the server.  The car is currently INOP, as in on but not in operation.  We may at a future date start by sending "neutralize" or "zero out" type commands to the car but for now we assume it's just sitting there.

- [] The server starts, we will create a websocket handler and begin to design a protocol for interfacing with the car.
- [] Separate from these websocket commands are some internal state handlers.  
- [] The websocket can modify these internal states
- [] There is a callback at some frequency that updates the physical model to the virtual one (moves servos, etc.)
- [] We write tests.  Lots of tests.
