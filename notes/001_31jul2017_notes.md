# Notes

This is the first set of notes for this project so here is a brief outline:

- We have a server on the car that receives & executes commands and returns us data.
- We have a client on a computer or elsewhere that allows us to send commands to the server and display data

## Server (Car)

- Python
- Tornado web framework
- Some traditional HTTP endpoints
- Commands received via WebSocket
- Higher freq data sent back via WebSocket


## Client (Computer)

- Possibly an Angular or React App
- Reads keypresses and sends commands to the car
- Other user interface items send commands to the car
- Some display of data returned from the car

## Pain Points

- Should I use Angular?  What if I don't love typescript?
- Will I hack myself into a corner if I use Angular?
- Will the instance of the car's data in Tornado be available to other websocket connections?  
- Regarding the above, I am going to generally ignore security implications since this is a hobby project
- There are many moving parts in this: process automation will be necessary
- Moving code to the RPI will be a hassle so I will probably want to set up some automatic transfers and build processes
