Some thoughts on the last few months:

- First, having kids and a life precludes a lot of coding
- Second, there have been challenges.

First, hardware has been tough although I found a good store here I can buy stuff at.  My biggest lesson there was that you should find a good store and save yourself weeks of shipping and the extra cost associated with buying things online.

## Now, notes:

1. Both motors run forward and backward
2. The battery charges
3. The battery charges everything (!! hurray !!)
4. - The soldering on the 5v stepdown is bad, if it jiggles the RPI can restart
5. I need to figure out the GPIO schema.

So here we are:

## GPIO Schema

MC33296 Pins
GPIO 5, 6, 12, 13, 22, 23, 24, 25
PIN29 == GPIO05
PIN31 == GPIO06
PIN32 == GPIO12
PIN33 == GPIO13
PIN15 == GPIO22
PIN15 == GPIO23
PIN18 == GPIO24
PIN22 == GPIO25


Gyro has 4 pins:
PWR PIN02 == 5v PWR
GND PIN09 == GND
PWM PIN12 (GPIO18)

Servo has 4 pins: 
PWR PIN01 == 3.3v PWR
SDA PIN03 == GPIO02
SCL PIN05 == GPIO03
GND PIN09 == GND
