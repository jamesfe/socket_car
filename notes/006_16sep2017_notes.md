# Front End Notes: 16 Sep 2017

## Thoughts

It would pay some dividends to think of how I'll do the front end stuff before I get too far in.

First steps might include some 'override' buttons that will send messages.
Before that, how do I develop on this?
We need several components:

1. serve the angular app
2. Run the car servo
3. Run some tests from time to time
4. Edit the code. (Should I install Visual Studio?)
