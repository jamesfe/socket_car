## Hardware work

The last few weeks have been a lot of work on my kids, followed in a far last place by this project.

First things first: it appears there is enough voltage to run the big servo, so we will go with that.  Why not?

Major problems running the servo at first, but then I thought maybe I'd just install pigpio (http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/python.html) and see how things went.  

It looks like if I start the `pigpiod` daemon then the wiringpi script will work (likewise the pigpio script works like a charm) but if I don't start the daemon then it won't work.

More investigation on this later but I will now sandwich up the PWM board with this new configuration and see if my soldering job was sufficient. (Fingers crossed.)
