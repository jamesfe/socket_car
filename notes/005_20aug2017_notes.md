# Notes 20 August 2017

I implemented a colored logging system (very gucci) on gstalker today using a lib called `coloredlogs` which has proven to look pretty nice.  I'm happy to not be reinventing the wheel on this one.

To celebrate that, I copied that code into this repo and did a little work; it looks nice.  Hopefully it is useful when I start running the car and want logs.

Also of note, I created a periodic callback http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/ioloop.html#tornado.ioloop.PeriodicCallback which was fairly easy.  It looks like it works but who knows, time will tell.

I did more research on the physical side.  I need to figure out a few major items:
1. How do I power everything?
2. How do I control the motors (ESC, L293 chip, GPIO direct (probably not)), etc.
3. Something about mounting and maybe the servo.
4. Power specs for the motors: how powerful do they need to be?
5. General list of items I need.

## Next Steps

- [X] Create a callback to the physical state
- [ ] Do more research on ESCs and motors
- [ ] Create a framework for logging things out to file
- [ ] Create an endpoint to return last n states of the vehicle
- [X] Create a health check
- [X] *easy* do the inc/dec speed work on the websocket handler
- [X] Return a health check with every command
- [X] Logging in general
- [ ] **front end** needs much research and work
