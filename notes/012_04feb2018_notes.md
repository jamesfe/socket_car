# Notes Feb 2018

Many issues:
1. If you attach your servo to a separate battery pack from the one that powers your rPi, you will need to ground the battery pack and the pi together.  This allows the PWM signal to return through the servo circuit.
2. If you have shitty connections and have used alligator clips, expect erratic behavior.
3. Servos are fairly mysterious things to me, so I had to write a test script to check and make sure I was within range.

Next
1. If I turn and increment the turn, it'll be tough to control the car from the GUI.  So I think tonight I will work on sending the message as long as the key is down but no longer.  After that I will zero the servo.
