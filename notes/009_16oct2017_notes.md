## Materials

Maybe balsa isn't such a good idea.  I think I should look into a more flexible platform that allows me to change things as I see fit.

Maybe a Tamiya Plate set: https://www.amazon.com/Tamiya-70157-Universal-Plate-Set/dp/B001VZHRXG/

Maybe some metal strips: http://spiratronics.com/pcb-hardware-and-enclosures/sheet-and-strip-materials/perforated-metal-strip.html

Control servo + motors with PWM: https://www.amazon.com/16-Channel-12-bit-Servo-Driver-Interface/dp/B00EIB0U7A/
Servo: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014KONJZY/
Ultra cheap motors: https://www.amazon.com/15000-16500RPM-Electric-Science-Experiments-Topoox/dp/B073Q2Y3RC // I can upgrade these later? gearbox?

Possible Motor/gearbox combo: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001Q0Z602/ref=psdc_2514571011_t1_B001Q119AC

Big problem here is that the gearbox combos are not flexible.  It might be wiser just to get gearbox attachments that don't fit a specific motor.
